#Instructions

Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Tailand in 2009.  Analyze and report on the apparent effectiveness of the three different drugs. Does sex of the participant seem to be a factor for any of the drugs?


# South Carolina

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.


# Central Africa

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.



# Korea

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.
